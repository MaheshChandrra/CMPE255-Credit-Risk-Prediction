# Abstract

Banks lose a significant amount of money as a result of credit defaults, and it is ultimately ordinary customers who bear the brunt of this error. Credit Risk Analysis is used by banks to ensure that credit is supplied to a trustworthy consumer. Credit risk is defined as the risk of defaulting on a loan as a result of the borrower's failure to make mandatory debt payments on time.  The lender assumes this risk because the lender loses both the capital and the interest on the loan.Machine Learning-based credit risk analysis eliminates the time-consuming human process of assessing numerous criteria and conditions on which credit can be granted. In the process, it also eliminates the human factor of mathematical mistake and corruption.From this project we aim to build a model to predict whether a person is eligible to get a credit or not. The decision depends on his/her banking history and other parameters mentioned below.
